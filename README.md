# üìã Project TODOs: Traumtag Momente Service

## 1. Determine Tech Stack
Goal: Get to a good MVP fast, with a tech stack that is easy to maintain and scale. Choose cheap and well tested options. Choose tools that are well understood by AI so that AI can help us with the development.
- [x] Frontend framework  
- [x] CSS / component library  
- [x] Backend framework  
- [x] Database  
- [x] Object storage  
- [x] Hosting / CDN  
- [x] Authentication  
- [x] QR-code generation  
- [x] CI/CD & DevOps  
- [x] Documentation of final decisions
Note see "Tech stack spec.md" for more details

## 2. Build & Ship MVP (Goal: ship in 2‚Äì4 weeks)
### 2.1 Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Git repos (frontend & backend)  
- [x] Configure CI/CD pipelines  (done later, or maybe not needed when using Vercel)
- [x] Provision database & object storage (done locally for now) 

### 2.2 Backend API
- [x] `POST /events` ‚Üí create event (slug, type, settings)
- [x] `POST /events/:slug/prompts` ‚Üí create new prompt
- [x] `PUT /events/:slug/prompts/:promptId` ‚Üí update prompt
- [x] `DELETE /events/:slug/prompts/:promptId` ‚Üí delete prompt
- [x] `GET /events/:slug/prompts` ‚Üí fetch next prompt  
- [x] `POST /events/:slug/uploads` ‚Üí handle image + metadata  
- [x] Serve generated QR as SVG/PNG  

### 2.3 Frontend
- [x] Organizer Dashboard (list/create events)  
- [x] Event-creation wizard (slug, type, prompts)  
- [x] Guest upload page (prompt display + upload form)  
- [x] Public gallery page (grid of uploads)

### 2.4 Deployment & Testing
- [x] Deploy MVP to staging & production  
- [x] Mobile-first QA & cross-browser testing  
- [x] Soft launch with pilot users  
- [x] Collect initial feedback & bug reports  

### 2.5 Testing Feedback
- URL-Slug is a technical term, we should use a more user friendly term for it, and also make it mor clear what it is (also maybe shwo the whole url)
- clicking on "Create Event" should show a loading indicator
- clicking on "create event" should, if successful redirect to the event dashboard, on mobile (on desktop, at least just now, it worked). I think it does but in the actually deployed version Im redirected to the auth/signin page, even though I should be logged in
- magic link email is not sent in deployed state (maybe we need more logs to debug this)
   - I created an api key, put it into the env vars on vercel
- newly created events are not visible in the dashboard (I see in the db that these events were created and are correctly associated with the email)

## 3. Post-MVP Features & Polishing
- [ ] Moderation & approval queue  
- [ ] Analytics dashboard (scans, uploads, per-prompt stats)  
- [ ] Bulk export (ZIP of images, PDF of QR cards)  
- [ ] Social-share integrations (pre-formatted cards)  
- [ ] Gamification: badges, leaderboards, point system  
- [ ] Custom branding & white-label domains  
- [ ] Multilingual UI support  
- [ ] Public API & third-party webhooks  
- [ ] UI/UX refinements & accessibility audit  
- [ ] Performance optimizations & caching  
- [ ] Comprehensive user onboarding & docs

**Next Steps:**  
1. Assign owners & rough timelines to each sub-task.
